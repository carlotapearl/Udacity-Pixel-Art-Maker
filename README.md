![Project Example](https://github.com/carlotapearl/Udacity-Pixel-Art-Maker/blob/master/mockup-pixelartmaker.png)
 
Your users should be able to:

Dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid.
Choose a color.
Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
Your primary task is to implement the makeGrid() function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.

Skills Needed:
Front-end programming skills from JavaScript Foundations and Intro to jQuery, including:

* Defining variables with const and let
* Accessing the DOM using methods of the document object
* Declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects as event listeners
* Writing nested loops and using loop variables
* Although not a requirement, you are encouraged to use jQuery to manipulate the DOM for this project.
